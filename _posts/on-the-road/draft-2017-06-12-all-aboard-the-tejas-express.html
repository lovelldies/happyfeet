    <p>We are making our way from Goa to Mumbai, and find ourselves once again at the Carambolim Railway Station, better known to the visiting masses as Karmali. I think Karmali took precedence over Carambolim, as the trailing "m" normally leads to the butchering of names in Goa. A few examples are Candolim, Siolim, Cortalim, Borim, the list goes on.</p>

    <p>There some then thousand people at the platorm! This tiny railway station normally has a moving population of 17. That includes the stay dog taking a random piss on the tracks. Unfortunately school did not start off early, and we are met with a bunch of vacationers making their way back to their respective cities with bright lights and air that makes my uncle&apos;s 20-year old Bullet exhaust look good. Anyway, all it takes is a few steps away from the <em>junta</em> and we find ourselves with a lot of space to spead our arms. I put on my <a href="https://media.giphy.com/media/v9rfTQBNqdsSA/giphy.gif" target="_blank">CSI glasses</a> and realize that the doors of the train are closed. Hence the masses were strewn around on the platform. We get to our coach #7, which luckily did not have to may people around.</p>

    <p>First impression &ndash; The train looks really good. The huge windows are definitly a way forward. This country is finally showing signs of progress. Luckily the <em>junta</em> did rush to the doors like they normally do. All that education is finally start to kick in I guess. I should&apos;ve carried my box of medals and handed it out to all these people. They almost showed signs of forming a queue, suddenly some signs of patriotism emerged and a bunch of folks decided to get to ahead of themselves by forming a queue, and decided to push from all sides. Where are those medals when you need them.</p>

    <p>We found our seats easily. 77 and 78. Right next to the door. The train left bang on 1430. If I&apos;m not mistaken, it was supossed to depart at 1435. Maybe my watch was not calibrated to the position of the sun. I think the monsoon clouds might have got in the way of my sundial. Anyway, earlier is better than late.</p>

    <p>Hardly did we start moving, the staff totally kicked into their act. A bottle of Rail Neer (water) and newspapers for everyone. The staff had cool shirts and moved around pushing their cute carts, just like the cabin crew you see in the aircrafts. The only difference being that these guys are too chilled out for anyone&apos;s liking and would probably give zero f*cks if the average unsatisfied Indian male tried to flirt with them.</p>

    <p>A couple of kilometers in the trip and the train was flying, like as though all those years of piss and faeces hitting the tracks had finally come to some use. This one was moving at a really fast pace, unlike the slow coaches we&apos;ve taken in the past. IST 14:45 and we have just crossed Thivim. This eagle is totally flying.</p>

    <p>I&apos;m not sure why we&apos;ve got the corner most seats, but I guess it is because these are one of the two seater rows in the four cornsers of the coach. I&apos;m assuming the booking algorithm knew we were a couple and did not want some clown seating with us.</p>

    <p>Now getting to trains, I think I might know a thing or two about this complicated network of metal monstors pumping their way around this huge subcontinent. From sleeping in the cool Rajdhani to Delhi, to standing in the general compartments with potential murdereres from a certain North Indian state, I&apos;ve might have traveressed a huge part of this country using the Indian Railways. So when we realized that the Tejas express was running from a station right next door to home, we cancelled our tickets on the stupid Konkan Kanya and booked seats on the Tejas Express. Now I take my train journeys seriously alright and this journey was no joke for me. Let&apos;s now look at what the Tejas has to offer.</p>

    <hr>

    <h2>Ergonomics</h2>
    <p>I&apos;m assuming that the person incharge of ergonomics might have never sat in a train in his or her entire life.</p>

    <p>If you want to use a laptop, then I suggest your use it after you alight the train. Firstly laptops don&apos;s fit properly on the tray in front. You can&apos;t have the sreen opened up properly, and if the person in front of you decided to pus his seat back, then be prepared to say "Thank you Sir. Alleluiah, amen!", as you entire tray will move back and basically there is not point to life after this. Let&apos;s not get too excited about this, as I&apos;ve not had any expectations from the ergonomics department.</p>

       caption="Seems like the quality of the arm rests was a little on the cheaper side."
       datasrcset="https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4224/34443440454_1de2b3e63a_n.jpg 320w, https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4224/34443440454_1de2b3e63a.jpg 500w, https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4224/34443440454_1de2b3e63a_z.jpg 640w, https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4224/34443440454_1de2b3e63a_c.jpg 800w, https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4224/34443440454_1de2b3e63a_b.jpg 1024w, https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4224/34443440454_314aa911e9_h.jpg 1600w, https://farm5.staticflickr.com/4224/34443440454_95edde8d9e_k.jpg 2048w" %}

    <p>The arm rests don&apos;t fold up. Which mean only one thing. People with a lot of fat deposits on their upper thighs are going to have a tough time squeezing into their seats. This also means less physical contact with the missus who is sitting next to me. Our midriffs wont get to touch for sure. After a few tries we realized that the arm rests did move up. It just happens that you need a gym membership to get it to work</p>

    <p>The sliding doors are horribly designed. Pretty tough for the older folks and kids to handle. It seems like they&apos;ve not learnt anything from those gullotine doors they had provided on the double decker train earlier. A few kids almost getting their skulls smashed in (which would be nice for the population issue we have), and older folks just did not know what to do when they reached the doors.</p>

    <h2>Cleanliness</h2>
    <p>We were greated to a lot of trash on the floor.</p>

    <p>Now before we can embrace on an assualt on the cleaning staff, we have to note that they had cleaned up most of the mess (based on the trash bags in the entrance). The rest of the trash lying around were chocolate and other wrappers which were shoved into the trays and corners. This is the mentality of the average Indian. Litter and mess up whatever you can, because someone will come clean up after you. All these fools have to be given Bharat Rathnas. #CongratsIndia. Overall the train was pretty clean, because that&apos;s what new trains are like &ndash; clean.</p>

    <h2>Comfort</h2>
    <p>The seats are quite comfortable and push a long way back. The lower back support seems to be okay, but there is someting off about it at the same time. I think I might have accumulated some extra fat on the back side. I&apos;ll give the Indian Railways the benefit of doubt on this one. The seats are also extremely high.</p>

    <p>Leg room was a winner though. A lot of space to move your legs around. Tall folks would love these seats.</p>

    <p>Storage space also gets extra points. The overhead storage racks were pretty spacious, and there was enough space to shove a small bag under your seat. There was space to store a coupld of bigger suitcases behind our (last) seats, and the aisles were pretty spacious too.</p>

    <p>The air conditioning is maintained at a pretty livable temperature so far. The quest to transport frozen bodies must only be a thing on the double decker trains. 14:55 and we are in Pernem!</p>

    <h2>Food: Snacks</h2>
    <p>I&apos;m breaking food into two sections. One for snack sessions, which includes breakfast and tea. And another for meals &ndash; lunch and dinner. The only reason for doing is this because the meals were pathetic and I shall tackle that later.</p>

    <h2>Entertainment</h2>
    <p>Man, I&apos;m impressed so far. I don&apos;t understand what drove those renegades on the first few trains to break the LCD screens, but this entertainment system is keeping the damn noisy kids quiet, and for that I would like to hand out some medals</p>

    <p>The interface has a USB charging point, two slots for earphones, a reading light (with adjustable brightness), and power button to turn the damn thing off if you wish. The language options are a little surprising. I was was expecting Hindi to be thrown in somewhere, but it seems like these devices might have come from our neighbours on the other side of the himalayas. Hence the Cantonese and other languages that don&apos;t make any sense to me are included. I put the UI through some testing, but it seem like only the main menus seem to change on changing languages. The rest of the content still displays in English. Anyway, lets not waste our time on this. Candy Crush remains in English no matter what, and that&apos;s what what&apos;s keeping the sanity of this boogie in check and praise the cow god for that!</p>

    <p>The older couple on the other side of our aisle were more intersted in looking out of the window and reading the newspaper. Hence their screens were of no use to them. Priya is busy reading her <a href="//www.harukimurakami.com/book/men-without-women" target="_blank" title="Men Without Women">new Murakami book</a> and clicking photos of the passing landscape. But lets take not away any credit from these sceens, the true heroes of this journey. Everyone&apos;s puke orifices are shut, thanks to all the lame movies that they are being served.</p>

    <p>When another passenger asked for earphones they told her that they were either out of them or they were spoilt. Can&apos;t blame the staff though. Getting to the earphone slots, they are the dual channel slots. Both of my slots don&apos;t work (with different earphones), and only one of Priya&apos;s works. Another stupid installation. Luckily I have my own music on my phone, which I shall listen too. On our return journey, both the slots worked. So I&apos;m assuming a strict quality check was not done.</p>

    <p>Inter Radio did not work. I guess the WiFi option is only available to the folks on the Executive Class. A few passengres asked the staff regarding the WiFi, to which they informed them that they haven&apos;t started the WiFi service yet. Bummer.</p>

    <p>The Public Information System (PIS) needed to go home, as they the information did not make any sense considering that our train was moving. I&apos;m assuming this was because of the fact that the time on the tabs were not properly set. Anyway, here are a bunch of messages we received while our train was blazing away to glory.</p>

    <p>16:30 and we have stalled at <a href="https://www.google.co.in/search?q=Vilavade" target="_blank">Vilavade</a>. I guess we have stalled for a higher priority train to pass. 16:40 and we crossing paths with the <a href="//www.cleartrip.com/trains/50106" target="_blank">Sawantwadi - Diva</a> passenger train. 16:43 and we are moving once again.</p>

    <p>So far the journey has been very comfortable. I&apos;m loving the speed at which this train is moving. The staff have been no-nonsense and nice. The snacks have been great. The people have been silenced thanks to technology. A few mini-paaji kids are walkin up and down the aisle, with their plastic toy guns minding their own business, taking aim at me at times. Time to enroll them in an American school.</p>

    <p>17:00 already, and time has flown by. The tain is pretty clean right now. The cleaning staff came and sobbed the place up. We will have to wait and see how our coach mates handle themselves. I&apos;m keeping some hope. We are gonna keep this coach clean. Time for some <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=brqZ6jZiOFE" target="_blank" title="Botch - We Are The Romans">Botch</a> and a short nap.</p>

    <p>17:23 and we are at Ratnagiri. I receive an feedback call from Indian Railways to rate the cleanliness of the platform and the train. That chap who just sobbed the floor totally knew this was coming. Anyway, full marks for cleanliness and timing.</p>

    <h2>Toilets</h2>
    <p>The toilets were a disappointment. Firstly they were dirty. Tissue paper thrown all around &ndash; the passergers are to be blamed for this. The floor was a full rubber mat, but it did not seem to have a fast (floor) drainage system, hence the floor was filled with water. Thank god for the rubber mat. I took a nice piss, and then came the time to flush. Remember all those news article complaining about people not flushing the toilets? You can&apos;t blame them (the passengers).</p>

    <p>Everyone was going on about how Indians don&apos;t deserve this and blah blah. But if the authorities cared to follow some standards in the first place, we would not have these un-flushed toilets. It took me a good 30 seconds to figure out that the unmarked shiney knob was the flush button, as there was nothing else in the toilet that looked like a flush button/handle. So good citizen me gave a light press to the knob. Nothing. So I looked around for another button. Nothing. Now my piss is moving around the commode like a volcano being agitated by an earthquake, ready to spoill its wrath all over my feet. Hence the need to locate the flush button fast! So I give the shiney knob another press. It seemed to budge. Or was I just imagining? I gave it one last push using all the force from my shoulder, and tada! Down went my piss and the volcano was made dormant. They forgot to put a sign outside the toilet saying "body-builders only".</p>

    <p>Before we exit the toilet, let&apos;s take a moment to think about the blind people. Now the authorities might boast about the train being friendly to the visually impared, but I&apos;m leaning more towards a bunch of lazy people just using this as an excuse to get more grants to fill their personal pockets. Absolutely zero thought has been put into the placement of the braille signs. The braille signs for the seat numbers are put on top of the windows, where even a person with normal eye-sight would not notice. Now imagine a blind guy having to lean over two people to find his seat. If the authorities had the brain of a four year old, they would be the braille signs on the aisle seats. This is just one example.</p>

    <p>Now imagine you are a visually impaired person, who wants to take a sh*t. Good luck finding the loo, as the braille signs are all over the place. Now you&apos;ve made it to the loo. Firstly there are not protocols followed and none of the signs (even for fully sighted folks) are in the same place. One of the toilets even had the flush button on the opposite side of the commode. Anyway, now imagine running your hands all over the walls of the toilet, touching piss, spit and god-know what else, jut trying to wash your hand, and use the flush. Absolutely no tough has been put into this. Its like someone handed out a bunch of stickers and asked these railway clowns to stick them wherever they wish. This is where your tax money goes. Into the hands of people whose brains are no bigger than the turds that can&apos;t be flushed down the toilets they design.</p>

    <p>Tissue papers were also not stocked up. I&apos;m debating between lazy staff and unresourceful passengers. This was a tough one. Bottom line was I had to wipe my hand to my pants. Thank you fellow passengers and lazy staff. Same old country, same old issues.</p>

<p>05:55 &ndash; Tea and Coffee is being served. We opted for the Ginger tea, as Wagh Bakri is the brand we trust. Some toasts/rusk to accompany the drink. Now only to wait for our hot water flasks to turn up, and our party shall begin!</p>


Once again, the train is flying over the tracks!

0557 - The how water flash is here, and the mixing shall begin. The tea was pretty decent, but the toasts were quite a disaccpointment. Not like I had expected much. True, there was a slight ray of hope, but that was also cut off, after taking the first tea-dunked bite.

By the way, Mr. Amitabh Bacchhan is back at it again. Encouraging us to drink tea and coffee.

0615 and we are finally toning the speed a bit down. I guess Panvel is around the corner. Nice dark South-West monsson clouds are looming over our heads, read to explode anytime and unleash their wrath upon the unprepared commuters. Our man is finally stepping on 'em brakes. Letting them sparks fly on the tracks. The gentleman behind us is snoring like one of those stolen tractors that you would find on the streets of UP. The window pane might crack any moment. Time to take the earphones out.

0620 - Panvel.

The width of these 3-seated are a little not-so-wide. My arms (I'm in the middle seat) are popping into the space of the neighbouring seats. I'm having an elbowing battle with the missus, while the nice old man to my left is keeping his arm to himself.

0630 - And we are rolling once again.

The man to my left. Who seems to be a 60+ year old gentleman (let's call him Mr. Patil) has finally looked at the tab in front of him, which is off. The is the best use case to test out the UI and UX of this great feature that everyone has been raving about.

Unfotunatley he has been clicking on the LED light button multiple times. After a few tries I show him the power button and get the tab started. Finally we are looking at the home screen. Mr. Patil keeps pressing the home button and the tab goes into the "loading screen". And just stays there. For minutes. I click on the tab again and it come back to the home screen.

Mr. Patil seems to only speak Marathi. I don't speak Marathi, but I understand a bit of it, so I guess communication should not really be an issue. Mr. Patil has now found the Music section. Unfortunately headphones were not given out. No headphones for anyone. Nada. People are expected to enjoy the music by looking at the time ticker move across the screen. Now, lets not bame the Indian Railways, after the crazy earphone vandalism that the commuters had done on the inagural rides.

On the bright side, the time on the tabs is finally synced to IST. My watch at the tab are both synced to the second. 06:41 on both. We are winning!

The newspapers are here. There is a wide choice of dailies, in different languages too. We opt for the Indian Express, as the missus says that it is the least sh*tty paper from the lot we could choose from.

Mr. Patil in the manwhile is clicking on different songs. I'm assuming he is expecting one of them to suddenly blare out. I mentioned that he would need to ask the attendant for earphones. Then Mr. Patil suddenly asks me in Marathi is I speak Marathi. So I, continuing in Hindi, mention, "No, I speak only Hindi and English". Then he asked me where I'm from, and I told hom Goa. And then he was like, "You are from Goa and you don't speak Marathi?" So I, in my head was like, "Why don't you go f*ck yourself Mr. Patil?" But I said, "No we don't really speak Marathi in Goa. Most people speak English and Konkani." And the rest of the conversation went as follows.

0655 - Breakfast is served. - Back to these details later.

Mr. Patil, "But most people in Goa speak Marathi!"
Me, "Is it?"
"Yes. I'm also from Goa, and I speak Marathi."
"Where are you from?"
"Bicholim. Everyone in Bicholim speaks Marathi."
Ah what a bouncer. Mr. Patil is actually Mr. Gaonkar.
I respond, "Yes, indeed, a lot of people in the extreme North of Goa do speak Marathi, I'm aware, but Konkani is the most spoken language if I'm not mistaken. Along with English."
Mr. Gaonkar nods.
What is your name?"
So I tell him my name.
"Ah, Catholic." And he must have thought, no wonder your bloody m*ther f*cker don't speak Marathi.

Luckily the attendant came around serving breakfast and the conversation was cut short. Breakfast was pretty dapper. A non-veg serving for me, and a veg serving for the missus. Bset of both worlds for us to share.

Mr. Gaonkar can mentioned that I missed out on the panchayat elections. To which I nodded and said, "Yes." I think I'm not going to entertain this Marathi fanatic from now on. Good luck figuring out how to use the tab now. No Angry Birds for you!

1130 - Soup is being served. Along with a couple of slices of bread and butter. They aren't handing out spoons or knives, so I don't know how we are supposed to apply the butter onto the bread. We asked an attendant for a spoon, he smiled and said they don't have any.

The audio on these tabs are pretty good. Both our units have good audio surprisingly. And there are a few English movies under the Hindi movie folder. All the movies have "_clean" in their file names.
