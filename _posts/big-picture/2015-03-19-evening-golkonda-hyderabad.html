long_excerpt: Of friends who are family. Conversations that never end. Of setting suns
  and endless laughter. Of joy in the simple things. Of loving and living in a crowded
  city that has old corners and hidden stories if you know where to look. Sankranti,
  13th January, 2013 with the Ramachandrans. And one D'souza.
