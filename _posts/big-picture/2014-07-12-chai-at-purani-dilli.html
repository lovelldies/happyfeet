    <p>It was a pleasant March evening when after visiting the <a href="https://happyfeet.us/big-picture/jama-masjid-old-delhi/" title="Jama Masjid (Old Delhi)" target="_blank">Jama Masjid</a>, we walked the tiny gallis and mohallas of Purani Dilli, discovering the charming city through its street treats. With foodie <a href="https://bluecabbage.blogspot.in/" title="Of this and that" target="_blank">Rahul Ganguly</a> as our guide and his wife Madhurima as his assistant, no piece of culinary history went unnoticed and un-hogged. After we entered a food coma of sorts, Rahul took us to this modest chaiwallah who he claimed doled out the closest equivalent of the glorious Irani Chai in Hyderabad, which we all loved. We put the good manâ€™s tea test and after many cups of experimenting with the kadak-ness of the chai, we gulped down more than a few winning cups.</p>
