title: The Myriad Colors of the Morning
excerpt: The first few rays of the sun lit up the sky after a short while and we witnessed this brilliant sunrise. The Devikulam town nested between the mountains.
long_excerpt: Munnar was dirty, ugly and full of tourists behaving like stray cattle. So we decided to head to Devikulam instead. We met a few locals who advised us not to miss the sunrise the next morning. So we kicked our laziness aside, woke up really early the next morning, rode through the freezing cold and made our way through some lush green tea estates.
