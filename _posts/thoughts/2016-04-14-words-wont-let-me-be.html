  <div class="inner">
    <p>No, no, what is this I see?<br />
    Dancing lights in front of me<br />
    Bright, shiny orbs wake me from my stupor<br />
    Thumping against my chest</p>
    <p>Words, are you?<br />
    You’ve escaped!<br />
    Already broken free<br />
    No no, this was not meant to be.</p>
    <p>Pretty words, I have to swallow you back<br />
    I’ve not yet breathed meaning into you<br />
    I’ve not examined your intentions<br />
    or dissected your souls<br />
    I’ve not yet labelled you<br />
    We have to wait<br />
    We have to navigate<br />
    We have to be sensible, you know?<br />
    We can’t just let our delirium show</p>
    <p>No, no, wayward words, you can’t be so bright.<br />
    Not so full of magic and light</p>
    <p>Fade a little, lustrous words!<br />
    No one wants to see you<br />
    or hear you<br />
    or devour you<br />
    Like I did on that moonlight night<br />
    When you tumbled out of a beautiful mouth.<br />
    Vagabond words.<br />
    Rambling, journeying words,<br />
    You made home in little corners of me I didn’t know existed.</p>
    <p>No, no, don’t let me stray, silly words.<br />
    Don’t just pour out.<br />
    We don’t just blurt it out</p>
    <p>We curate and compile <br />
    A nip here, a tuck there.<br />
    Some caution here and restraint there…<br />
    So we can make neat little sentences<br />
    Pleasing and perfect<br />
    Not an article out of place</p>
    <p>No, no, stubborn words<br />
    Stop rolling out like a hurricane<br />
    Your rebellion is showing<br />
    The crazy winds are blowing<br />
    Look what you’ve done<br />
    Kicking up the sand<br />
    Rustling up the leaves<br />
    We can’t have this chaos.</p>
    <p>Simmer down, wandering words<br />
    Your sharp taste of  tangerine<br />
    Tart and juicy <br />
    Is just too much</p>
    <p>Water down, gypsy words<br />
    Dim your shine</p>
    <p>Or one day,<br />
    When I’m not careful enough<br />
    Maybe, because I was gazing too long <br />
    At a starry, starry night<br />
    When the air has the right amount of madness...<br />
    Lustful words, I know you’ll turn on me<br />
    Turn inside of me<br />
    Turn into dazzling, light sabres<br />
    Fierce, wild and unhinged<br />
    And you’ll shred my insides<br />
    Till all I am is just tiny fragments of light<br />
    Luminous like the cosmos<br />
    And we can’t have that, can we?</p>
