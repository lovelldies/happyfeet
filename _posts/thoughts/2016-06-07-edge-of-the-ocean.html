<section class="wrapper wrapper-inner style1 align-left">
  <div class="inner">
    <p>A cheerless cobbled street leads you to her locked-up world.<br />
    No window sills with roses or geraniums here.<br />
    No magic or daydreams.<br />
    No laughter nor life.</p>
    <p>It’s quiet up here.<br />
    Filled with things no one wanted.<br />
    Things left behind.<br />
    A forgotten suitcase of abandoned memories.</p>
    <p>It once wasn’t so.<br />
    It once was a riot of colours.<br />
    A laudanum-induced delirium of a dream.<br />
    Of intense joy, unbearable sorrow.<br />
    And everything in between.</p>
    <p>Life, the anesthetic, then did his business.<br />
    Numbing what once was aflame.<br />
    Freezing what once was frenzied.</p>
    <p>A treasure chest of moments.<br />
    Anchored to the bottom of everything alive.<br />
    At the edge of the ocean, <br />
    her reflection just a watery spectre.<br />
    Drop a pebble and it’s gone.</p>
