title: Before me, there was infinity.
excerpt: There was just light and a bellowing sound. Nothing else, not even a void, was around. No mortal flesh, tainted and ugly. No scars. No wars.

    <p>There was just light and a bellowing sound.<br />
    Nothing else, not even a void, was around.<br />
    No mortal flesh, tainted and ugly.<br />
    No scars. No wars.<br />
    Not a single thought made its way across the grassy fields.<br />
    For there were no grassy fields. No breeze.<br />
    It was dark, it was bright.<br />
    There was no day or night.<br />
    Before love, before joy and before tears,<br />
    before pain and pleasure and the darkest fears.<br />
    Before everything I could ever know or seeâ€¦<br />
    Before me, there was infinity.</p>
