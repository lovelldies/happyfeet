    <p>I&#8217;m no early bird. It is very rare that I&#8217;m watching the sun rise. But thanks to the <a href="http://www.uefa.com/uefachampionsleague/season=2015/final/" target="_blank">Champions League</a> final, followed by some non stop <a href="https://www.easports.com/fifa/features" target="_blank">FIFA</a>, we (Daniel &#038; I) were up till dawn and finally decided to call it quits and head home.</p>

    <p>I had to make my way from Tonca (Panjim) to Old Goa. The road home is a drive along the <a href="https://www.flickr.com/photos/lovelldies/6299849964/" target="_blank">Mandovi River</a>. Here is an old video of me <a href="https://youtu.be/OYcUCf2Poj4?t=3m25s" target="_blank">driving around Goa</a>, which will give you an idea of what the drive is like (although I&#8217;m driving in the opposite direction in the video).</p>

       alt = 'Break of dawn.' %}

    <p>I made a pit stop opposite the Goa Institute of Management and took a few photos, while I enjoyed the sunrise.</p>

    <p>And finally I was home! Where the clouds continued to put on a show.</p>
