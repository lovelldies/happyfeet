    <p>It was to be the ultimate performance by <strong><a href="http://fb.com/musicfevergoa" title="Music Fever (Goa) on Facebook" target="_blank">Music Fever</a></strong> at <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LesliesMollyMalone" title="Facebook" target="_blank">Leslie&#8217;s Molly Malones</a> for the season and we all decided to head there and show them some love.</p>

    <p>Music fever were joined by the famous <strong>Daniel Carneiro</strong> aka Francis for a couple of tracks. I decided to capture some footage, which will be turned into a music video soon. Here are a few photos from that night. Some clicked by me, some clicked by others.</p>

    <p>Below we catch a glimpse of the boys from Music Fever, <strong><a href="http://fb.com/jonathan.zuzarte.1" title="Jonathan on Facebook" target="_blank">Jonathan Zuzarte</a></strong> &#038; <strong><a href="http://fb.com/nashvincunhagomes" title="Nashvin on Facebook" target="_blank">Nashvin Cunha Gomes</a></strong> while I set up a camera.</p>

    <p>And once again the occasion was graced by the evergreen couple <a href="http://www.lovelldsouza.com/weddings/melanie-daniel-goa/" title="Melanie's &#038; Daniel's wedding album by Lovell D'souza" target="_blank">Melanie &#038; Daniel</a> along with <a href="http://happyfeet.us/author/priya/" title="Priya's author page on Happy Feet." target="_blank">Priya</a>.</p>

    <p>Folks wanted a photo of the two of us. So here, admire this.</p>

    <p>The girls liked this photo of Daniel. But he begged to differ.</p>

    <p>Here we find a pack of locals in an uncontrolled environment, leaning in for a photograph. One tries to use his phone to assist in finding a bright spot for the camera to focus while another makes an attempt to photo bomb.</p>
