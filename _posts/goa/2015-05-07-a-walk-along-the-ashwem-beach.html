title: A walk along the Ashwem Beach
excerpt: As we lazily ambled along the Ashvem Beach, enjoying the seaside breeze, sights and sounds, Lovell captured a few snapshots from the beautiful evening.
long_excerpt: It was for one such sunset shoot that we drove for 40-odd kilometres from Old
  Goa to Ashvem beach on a beautiful summer evening. The sky was just the right kind
  of cloudy. The quiet beach was a perfect stretch of clean sand, happy dogs and a
  whole lot of wildlife, both alive and dead. As we lazily ambled around, enjoying
  the seaside breeze, sights and sounds, Lovell captured a few snapshots from the
  beautiful evening.

    <p>Let me just come out and say it… Yes, we live in Goa. No, we don’t visit the beach every day! Not even once a week. Maybe, once in two months. But that’s just Miramar Beach, only because you can eat some delicious <em>sev puri</em> on the road leading to it. In fact, of all the times that we found ourselves on a beach lately, most visits have been thanks to complete strangers. Over the years, couples from across the country, who want seaside memories from their love stories, weddings, anniversaries or holidays captured for their progeny (or digital timelines), have trusted <a href="//www.lovelldsouza.com" target="_blank">Lovell</a> to do the job. And in the process of capturing their moments, we get to make some of our own. Thanks to determined lovebirds, who wake up early to be shot in the first light of the day, we have experienced many seaside sunrises that we otherwise would have dozed away. Thanks to the warmth of couples who let us into intimate moments in their lives, countless sunsets on the beach have been made extra special for us.</p>
