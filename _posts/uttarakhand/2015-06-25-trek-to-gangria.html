long_excerpt: Day 4 of our trip to the Valley of Flowers and we found ourselves at Gobind Ghat. From there it was around a 15 kilometer trek to Gangria, which took us roughly 7 hours to complete. The air was pristine, views were spectacular and the trek was painstakingly slow thanks to the lack of oxygen.
