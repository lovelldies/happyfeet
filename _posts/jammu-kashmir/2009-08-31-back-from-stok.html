title: Back from Stok
excerpt: After hours of trekking along the Himalayas in the rain, we finally got back to our base (place from where we started the trek), put our legs up and just soaked in the beauty. This was our view. The mighty Himalayas providing us a lovely backdrop.

    <p>After hours of trekking along the Himalayas in the rain, we finally got back to our base (place from where we started the trek), put our legs up and just soaked in the beauty. This was our view. The mighty Himalayas providing us a lovely backdrop.</p>
    <p>Here is a video of Danny and I improvising on our way back. It was recorded on a Nokia E71, so please bear with the quality. The volume of water flowing in the streams along the mountains had picked up due to the rains that kept pouring down. Luckily it wasnâ€™t a heavy downpour, else we would have been doomed.</p>

    <p>This was one tiring trek and we were glad to make it back in one piece.</p>
